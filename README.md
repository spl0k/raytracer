# Raytracer

Just having fun trying to make a raytracer in Python âœ¨

Using Python 3.6 for now.

## What can it render?

![The void](void.png?raw=true)

If you stare into the void, the void stares back at you.

## Goals

- Rendering a scene defined in some files (in YAML, probably)
- Simple objects at first: sphere, plane, triangles...
- Maybe 3D models later
- Ability to define some shader-inspired surface functions (could be more than a
  simple BRDF)
- Experimenting a bit with some Python stuff

## Non-goals

- A full/complete/whatever rendering engine
- Realtime
- Efficiency
- Being foolproof
- Writing tests (yeah I know it's bad, but I can't be bothered)
