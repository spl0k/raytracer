# Raytracer

Just having fun trying to make a raytracer in Python ✨

Requires Python 3.8

Do you like shields? Here are some.

## What can it render?

![Round](sphere.png?raw=true)

This is not a circle.

## Goals

- Rendering a scene defined in some files (in YAML, probably)
- Simple objects at first: sphere, plane, triangles...
- Maybe 3D models later
- Ability to define some shader-inspired surface functions (could be more than a
  simple BRDF)
- Experimenting a bit with some Python stuff

## Non-goals

- A full/complete/whatever rendering engine
- Realtime
- Efficiency
- Being foolproof
- Writing tests (yeah I know it's bad, but I can't be bothered)

## Author's note

You can take inspiration or copy the code if you like (it's MIT-licensed after
all) but be advised that I have a poor understanding of the math behind all
this. So some computations might be wrong. Feel free to file a PR if you like
but keep in mind that this is not a serious project.
